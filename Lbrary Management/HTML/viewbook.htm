            <h4>Kembral Thorne is spending a few hours away from her newborn,
                 and she's determined to enjoy herself at this party no matter what. 
                But when the guests start dropping dead, 
                Kem has no choice but to get to work. She is a Hound, after all, 
                and she can't help picking up the scent of trouble. She's not the only one.</h4>
